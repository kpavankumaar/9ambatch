    <p style="background-color:blue">Deepika and Ranveer are taking a break after a long and hectic year. While Deepika dedicated the last year to her film Chhapaak, Ranveer had multiple projects too. He had Gully Boy and was working with the cast of '83.</p>

<span>    Directed</span> by Kabir Khan, '83 will chronicle India's win under Kapil's captainship, when the team defeated West Indies in the final to clinch their first-ever World Cup trophy in 1983.

The sports drama will also mark Deepika and Ranveer's on-screen reunion, who have previously collaborated on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's spectacle films. In the past, the two have worked together in larger-than-life movies such as Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, Bajirao Mastani and Padmaavat.

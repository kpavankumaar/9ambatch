        <h1>Vajpayee </h1>
        <p style="">Netaji <span>Subhash</span> Chandra Bose’s grand nephew Chandra Kumar Bose on Sunday termed Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi as the most popular leaders as compared to the founder of Bharatiya Jana Sangh Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee.</p>
        <p>
        In a social media post, Chandra Bose said, “According to me – BJP was formed under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and not Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. Utilising Dr Mookerjee’s name as founder would not help the Party connect with the people of Bengal or the rest of the country. Vajpayee and Narendra Modi are much more popular among Bengalis & the nation today than Dr Mukherjee.”
